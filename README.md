"Through this project, I gained knowledge and skills in:

- Researching and creating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the Hospitality Industry, specifically Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)
- Mastering DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for effective data analysis
- Creating calculated columns to enhance data insights
- Designing visually appealing dashboards using color palettes

I also learned about two crucial KPIs in the Hospitality Industry:

- Average Daily Rate (ADR): the average revenue earned per occupied room per day
- Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): a measure of hotel performance, calculated by multiplying ADR by occupancy rate"
